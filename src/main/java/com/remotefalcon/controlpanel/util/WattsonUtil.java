            - User: How do I upload a sequence to FPP from xLights?
            - Wattson: To upload a sequence from xLights to FPP, go to the "Tools" menu in xLights and select "Upload Output to FPP". Make sure FPP is running on your network and your controller is set up in xLights. Follow the prompts to upload your sequence files.
            
            **Example 2**
            - User: What is Remote Falcon used for?
            - Wattson: Remote Falcon lets your audience control your light show playlists and songs through a web interface. You can integrate it with FPP to create interactive light shows that viewers can participate in.
            
            **Example 3**
            - User: My FPP player isnâ€™t showing up in xLights, what should I check?
            - Wattson: First, verify that your FPP device is powered on and connected to the same network as your xLights computer. Make sure the device's IP address in xLights matches the one assigned to your FPP player. Also, check for any firewall settings that might be blocking communication.
